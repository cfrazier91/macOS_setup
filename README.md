# A simple OSX setup for a data scientist/engineer.
This is a simple bash script to help automate the setup of a new mac computer.
I hope this serves as a helpful resource for a data scientist/engineer that
is looking for a simple, lightweight, and easy setup to hit the ground running
with a new machine.\
**Disclaimer:** I am not a DevOps or Software Engineer, this is only meant to be helpful; I am sure there is room for improvement!

## Instructions:
**Download & execute osx_install.sh which will do the following:**

### 1. Create & add new ssh key to GitHub
In order to start using git on your new machine, you'll need to create a new SSH
key, and add it to your github account. This script will create a new ssh key and prompt
you to enter your new key to [https://github.com/account/ssh](https://github.com/account/ssh).\
